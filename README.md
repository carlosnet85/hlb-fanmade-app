# As the title suggests 
So uhh... yeah, this is a project built in React dedicated to [Humanity's Last Breath](https://humanitys-last-breath.com/) metal band, they are just insane. 

i've been really concerned for making this **Open Source** because of the messy code (sorry lol), but you know what? it works like a charm. 

## how it works? 

Shortly, It has two arrows and type of "music gallery". Clicking on one of them redirects you to YouTube (more like, to the music itself). 

## How do i run this locally?
Just god knows why do you want to run this locally but... 

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download), must be 18.0+ version or the package manager will whine.
2. Clone/Download this repo.
3. Open terminal.
4. `cd` the main folder (which is hlb-project).
5. `npm install` to fill your disk with trashy files.
6. Type `npm run dev`.
7. Now prob running in http://localhost:5173.
